# Cement-Strength-Prediction
## Data Description:
### Cement (Input Variable) : 
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture.
### Blast Furnace Slag(Input Variable):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture. Blast furnace slag is a nonmetallic coproduct produced in the process. It consists primarily of silicates, aluminosilicates, and calcium-alumina-silicates.
### Fly Ash(Input Variable):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture. it is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases.
### Water(Input Vraible):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture.
### Superplasticizer(Input Vraibale):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture. Superplasticizers (SP's), also known as high range water reducers, are additives used in making high strength concrete. Their addition to concrete or mortar allows the reduction of the water to cement ratio without negatively affecting the workability of the mixture, and enables the production of self-consolidating concrete and high performance concrete.
### Coarse Aggregate (Input Variable):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture. Construction aggregate, or simply "aggregate", is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.
### Fine Aggregate(Input Vriable):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measurement in kg in a m3 mixture. Input Variable—Similar to coarse aggregate, the constitution is much finer.
### Age(Inpiut Vraible): 
    It is a quantitive variable. Day measured in(1~365).
### Concrete Compressive Strength(Outpu Vraible):
    It is a quantitive variable. Measured by MPa.
